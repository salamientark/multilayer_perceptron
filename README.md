## How I proceeded

#### Analyzing dataset

- First quick look of the data using dbeaver
The dataset is known and widely used for ML so we can easily find 
columns names.
- Describe database to see (mean, repartition, min/max...)
- Standardize data
- Plot pairplot to see correlation + correlation heatmap to see feature 
redundancy and predictive power

#### Splitting dataset
